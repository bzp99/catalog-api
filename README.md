# Prometheus-X Catalog Registry

The Prometheus-X Catalog Registry is a REST API service designed to handle updates of reference models from the Prometheus-X Reference Models GitHub repository and synchronize them with a database. In addition, it provides support for catalog instance-defined reference models, including roles, value sharing, business models, building blocks, requirements, and more.
